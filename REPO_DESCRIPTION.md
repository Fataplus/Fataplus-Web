# Fataplus Blueprints — Open Source Agritech Blueprint Catalog

Description
This repository publishes the Fataplus Open Source Blueprint Catalog for agritech in Africa and Madagascar. It provides a standardized, reusable collection of “Solution Blueprints” (apps and platforms) that agripreneurs, cooperatives, SMEs, NGOs, and developers can copy, customize, and deploy. The catalog follows an Apache 2.0 license and is designed to accelerate collaboration, experimentation, and impact.

What you’ll find
- A curated set of 100 blueprint ideas across key agritech domains (e.g., Farm Management, Market Linkage, Agri-Fintech, Post-Harvest).
- A machine-readable JSON Schema for blueprints (blueprint.schema.json) and Markdown templates (blueprint-template.md) to document each blueprint.
- Starter artifacts to publish and reuse:
  - design-system-fataplus.md
  - blueprint-schema.md
  - elevator-pitches.md
  - fataplus-digital-farm.md
  - SDG-mapping.md
- A minimal, open governance approach encouraging community contributions, pull requests, and collaboration.

How to use this catalog
- Read a blueprint.md to understand a blueprint’s purpose, scope, and requirements.
- Validate blueprint.json against blueprint.schema.json (or use the provided validation scripts in tools/).
- Copy a blueprint into your project, adapt it to your context (local language, available tech stack, budget), and publish it under the Apache-2.0 license.
- Contribute improvements, new blueprints, or revised templates via pull requests, following the project’s contribution guidelines.
